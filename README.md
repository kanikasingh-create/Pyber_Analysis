# Pyber Analysis
An analysis performed for Pyber to create an overall snapshot of the ride-sharing data, with a summary table of key metrics of the ride-sharing data by city type, and a multiple-line graph that shows the average fare for each week by each city type.

## Findings
* The ridesharing data and corresponding multiple line graph shows us that total fares in urban locations are higher than total rural or suburban fares. This does not indicate that individual ride fares in urban cities are higher: it may be the case that fares could vary between urban, rural, and suburban rides depending on distances. However, urban locations may have more frequent use of Pyber's services, hence the higher total fare amount.
